title: 'CNC Certification'

My freshman year, I decided to get my CNC mill certification ("blue tag") such that I could have access to Cal Poly's Haas 3-axis mills. To do this, I had to make 3 parts with a mentor.

My first project was a bending die for one of the bike builders tube benders. It was a rather simple part, with just 2 ops in aluminum. The goal with this was to get comfortable with the CNC controls. Despite being a simple part, I learned how to use in-process probing and 3d surfacing techniques. I machined this on our Haas Super Mini Mill. 

My second project was quite a bit more complex. I machined custom designed UDH dropouts for my hardtail mountain bike project (more [here](/projects/major_projects/hardtail_mtb)). Both dropouts are machined out of 15-5 stainless steel in 2 ops, with aluminum soft jaws for the second op. I'm especially happy with how the 3d surfacing turned out on the second ops.

My last certification project was simpler. Another bike builder offered to let me make some parts for his mechatronics project so I could finish my certification. These were small aluminum parts, machined in 2 operations with soft jaws for workholding on the second op.
