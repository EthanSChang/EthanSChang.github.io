title: '5 Axis Machining'
---

Over finals week I took the opportunity to learn how to use our 5-axis mill, a vf-2 with a trunnion. The part I made is part of a hold down release mechanism (HDRM) for PolySat. It's mostly a 3+2 part, but I took the opportunity to do a fully simultaneous 5 axis deburring toolpath.

My second ever part on the VF-2 was a integrated brake caliper mount and kickstand mount for my next bike build. The two slots on the top mount a flat mount caliper, and the two radiused surfaces will be welded to the rest of the frame. This was also my second time ever CNC machining steel (in this case mild steel). I did this in two OPs, a stock prep op (machining the dovetail) and a single op for the whole part.
