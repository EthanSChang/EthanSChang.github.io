title: 'Hardtail MTB'
---

I joined Cal Poly Bike Builders as a freshman with a interest in building bikes, but without something in mind. Eventually I came up with the idea to build a hardtail mtb, while I hadn't ever ridden a mountain bike before.

I based the geometry on the Neuhaus solstice, shooting for a trail bike that leans more towards the XC side.

<h4 style="text-align: center;">
I did all the cad for the bike in Onshape, including modeling custom dropouts based on the Paragon UDH dropouts. I also designed a custom laser cut (cut and bent from Send Cut Send) chainstay yoke.

Learning to weld, slowly but surely.

The first weld on the frame - the fusion weld for the seat tube collar!

The front triangle in the fixture and welded.

The plate yoke. The fixture I designed melted while tacking and got stuck to the yoke, but I made it work eventually. I also had to grind away and reweld one side because I was sloppy in cleaning the oxides off. Didn't go smoothly, but it worked out in the end.

The finished frame before powdercoat. It ended up weighing 5.9lbs before paint, not bad for a steel frame without any special butted tubing.

<h4 style="text-align: center;">
The frame after powdercoating. Quite a bit darker than the advertised color online. Reaming the seat post out to size was a chore since I naively undersized the collar by .005" thinking I would improve the fit.

The finished bike! 
</h4>

Specs:
 - Fork: Marzocchi bomber 130mm 
 - Drivetrain: Deore 11 speed, 32 chainring, 11-51 cassette
 - Brakes: Shimano MT501/520 (4 piston front, 2 piston rear), 180mm rotors
 - Seatpost: PNW Ranier, 31.6mm, 150mm travel
 - Wheelset: DT Swiss X1900 29", with Terravail Honcho (front) and Ehline (rear)

 Overall, I'm quite happy with the build. I do wish it was a bit lighter, but that's mostly due to the budget components. Maybe it's just my lack of knowledge of mtb, but it seems to ride well and I'm loving taking it on trails so far. Now for the full suspension...
