In Fall 2023, I joined Polysat, Cal Poly's cubesat program. I'm currently working on SAL-E, our 3u cubesat mission. Its primary goal is to be a rapid development mission to improve our team's processes and knowledge. It's carrying 3 payloads: a camera, a custom radiation sensor developed by other Cal Poly students, and a radio developed by students and OWL Integrations. 

My role on the team is to manufacture the satellite's structure. I've been helping with DFM analysis, tolerancing and anodizing considerations, fixture design, CAM development, and the actual CNC machining. So far I've made a couple parts, including counterweights and battery bracket components (see below).
