I was a part of the Mahaffee lab at USDA-ARS in Corvallis for three summers from 2022 to 2024. Our lab studied how pathogens disperse in agricultural settings. I was responsible for developing a novel way to sample grape powdery mildew fungal spores for analysis. I developed a 3D-printed sampler that uses either a handheld vacuum or a server fan to provide airflow. It relies on cyclonic separation, similar to how a shop vac operates. I also developed a system that can automatically switch between 6 different samplers.

<h3 style="text-align: center;">The cyclone sampler design. The geometry is quite challenging to print, and required a lot of settings optimizations. Blue is the main cyclone body; white is the adapter to the vacuum.</h3>

<h3 style="text-align: center;">The device I built to automatically switch between up to 6 samplers. It's controlled by an arduino nano and powered by a stepper motor and blower fan. It can be mounted to be a tractor and automatically take samples as the tractor is driven through a field.</h3>

<h3 style="text-align: center;">Testing the sampler using fluorescent microspheres as models for the fungal spores. We used these fluorescent particles to identify where particles were getting caught in the sampler. They are only 20-40 microns in diameter.</h3>

<h3 style="text-align: center;">One of my smaller projects: a folding sampling arm. Rotorod samplers use 2 vertical spinning rods (dark blue) coated in grease to collect airborne particulate. Some samplers have the rods fold down once the sampler stops spinning to protect the sample. My design is a version of the folding samplers optimized for 3d printing. The spring holding the rods closed is printed and integrated into the body (bottom of the light grey body). A cam (light blue) translates the vertical spring force into a rotary folding motion. As the sampler starts spinning, the centrifugal "force" overcomes the spring, pulling the rods out into the air.</h3>
